# Manual Ticket Distribution Solution

## Current Status
- **Email service issues**: Both SendGrid (credit limits) and Brevo (authentication) are blocked
- **17 free tickets** ready for distribution for R Y T H Y M > IN< R I D D I M
- **QR code generator tool** available for immediate manual distribution

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Manual QR Code Distribution
1. **Open the QR code generator**: `qr-code-generator.html`
2. **Generate all QR codes** for the 17 free ticket holders
3. **Screenshot or save** each QR code
4. **Manually send** via WhatsApp, SMS, or direct email

### Option 2: Fix Brevo Authentication
The authentication failed because the login email might be different from what's shown in the dashboard.

**Next steps:**
1. Check what email address you used to sign up for Brevo
2. Use that email as the SMTP login username
3. Keep the SMTP key: `ZmKA8246OLSjhGOO`

### Option 3: Upgrade MailerSend
1. Go to your MailerSend dashboard
2. Add payment method to remove trial restrictions
3. Complete domain verification with `savgent.com` (not `https://www.savgent.com`)

## Free Ticket Holders List
All 17 people who registered for free tickets are ready to receive:
- QR codes for entry
- Event details (July 19th, 2025)
- Venue information

## Recommendation
Use **Option 1** (manual QR distribution) for immediate results while we resolve the email service authentication in parallel.
