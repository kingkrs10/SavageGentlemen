You are updating an existing production web app for savgent.com.

The app already includes:
- A "Soca Passport" loyalty system with:
  - `/passport` page for logged-in users
  - Backend logic for stamps, tiers, rewards, etc.
- An events + ticketing system.
- User auth.

⚠️ IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

1. **Do NOT break or heavily refactor existing Soca Passport behavior.**
   - The current `/passport` route, backend models, and logic MUST remain functional.
   - All enhancements must be additive and backward compatible.
2. Any new tables, API routes, or pages must be implemented so that:
   - If they are disabled, the existing platform still behaves exactly the same.
3. Keep code organized and modular so future subscription features can be layered in later.

## PART 1 — PUBLIC ENTRY POINTS FOR SOCA PASSPORT

### GOAL

Enable:
1. **Global users** (not yet SavGent customers) to discover and sign up for Soca Passport.
2. **External event creators / promoters** (not affiliated with SavGent) to register and start using Soca Passport at their own events.
3. Set up **monetization scaffolding**:
   - Per-event fees (no subscriptions yet).
   - User upgrade tiers (paid membership levels).

The work in this task focuses mostly on:
- New pages: `GET /socaport-app`, `GET /passport-promoters`
- New onboarding flows for users and promoters.
- Database + API scaffolding for:
  - Per-event billing
  - User premium membership
- Minimal UI for these monetization features (we will refine pricing and UX later).

## 1. PUBLIC USER LANDING PAGE — `/socaport-app`

### Purpose

This is a **marketing + signup landing page** for Soca Passport that works for ANY user, even if they have never purchased a SavGent ticket.

**URL:** `https://savgent.com/socaport-app`

### Requirements

1. **Content / Sections**
   - Hero section:
     - Title: “Soca Passport”
     - Subtitle: “Your Caribbean Carnival Journey in One Digital Passport.”
     - CTA button: “Create Your Free Passport”
   - Benefits section:
     - Bullet points showing:
       - Track your events across multiple carnivals.
       - Earn Fête Credits and unlock perks.
       - Keep a digital record of your Caribbean journey.
   - How it works section (3 steps):
       1. Create your free passport.
       2. Attend passport-enabled events and get scanned.
       3. Collect stamps, earn rewards, and upgrade your status.
   - “For Promoters” teaser:
       - Small block with link to `/passport-promoters`.

2. **CTA Behavior**
   - If user is **not logged in**:
     - Clicking “Create Your Free Passport”:
       - Takes them to login/register (reuse existing auth flow), then redirects to `/passport`.
   - If user **is logged in but has no passport profile**:
       - Clicking CTA triggers a backend call to create a `passport_profile` for that user (reuse existing helper if it exists, or call something like `PassportService.getOrCreatePassportProfile(userId)`).
       - Redirect to `/passport`.
   - If user **already has a Soca Passport**:
       - CTA simply redirects directly to `/passport`.

3. **Implementation Notes**
   - Build `/socaport-app` as a React/Next.js page that:
     - Uses existing layout / header so it visually matches SavGent.
     - Is mobile-first and matches the screenshot style of the current `/passport` page (dark theme cards, etc.).
   - Keep copy and styling in-code so we can tweak later.

---

## 2. PROMOTER PORTAL ENTRY PAGE — `/passport-promoters`

We need a simple, clear entry point for external promoters.

**URL:** `https://savgent.com/passport-promoters`

(If the project already uses a “/partners” or “/admin” naming scheme, keep this page separate; it is NOT the same as the existing SavGent admin dashboard.)

### Purpose

- Explain Soca Passport from the **promoter** perspective.
- Let external event creators sign up and request access to use Soca Passport for their events.

### Requirements

1. **Content / Sections**
   - Hero section:
     - Title: “Soca Passport for Promoters”
     - Subtitle: “Reward your fête fans, track loyalty across events, and see who keeps coming back.”
     - Primary CTA: “Get Started as a Promoter”
   - Benefits section:
     - Short cards:
       - “Know Your Superfans” (repeat attendees, countries, circuits).
       - “Reward Loyalty Easily” (stamps + perks).
       - “Multi-Event Insights” (who follows you from city to city).
   - “How It Works” (for promoters):
       1. Create a promoter account.
       2. Add your event and enable Soca Passport.
       3. Scan attendees at the door and issue stamps.
   - Pricing note:
       - Simple placeholder text for now:
         > “Per-event pricing coming soon. During beta, you can request access to try Soca Passport at your event.”

2. **Promoter Signup Flow (MVP)**
   - For now, we just need:
     - A simple **promoter registration form** that stores data for manual approval:
       - Name
       - Email
       - Organization / brand
       - Primary location (city / country)
       - Website or IG handle
       - Type of events (fêtes, brunches, carnivals, etc.)
   - On submit:
     - Create a new `promoter` record (see DB section below).
     - Optionally link to the current `user` if logged in.
     - Show a confirmation screen:
       > “Thanks! We’ll contact you shortly to activate Soca Passport for your events.”
   - Make the flow compatible with future logic where:
     - Promoters can log in and manage events.

3. **Preserve existing admin dashboard**
   - This new promoter flow should NOT affect the current SavGent admin.
   - Implementation should assume promoters may be a different user role or table.

---

## 3. DATABASE CHANGES — PROMOTERS + PER-EVENT FEES + USER PREMIUM

Add new tables that are **scaffolding only** for now; minimal business logic is fine.

> Important: keep migration scripts safe and non-breaking.

### 3.1 New table: `promoters`

Represents external event creators that want to use Soca Passport.

Fields (example Postgres schema):

- `id` UUID PK
- `user_id` UUID NULL      -- optional FK → users(id) if they have a login
- `name` VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL
- `email` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
- `organization` VARCHAR(255) NULL
- `location_city` VARCHAR(120) NULL
- `location_country` VARCHAR(4) NULL      -- e.g. "US", "TT"
- `website_or_social` VARCHAR(255) NULL
- `event_types` VARCHAR(255) NULL         -- simple comma-separated or JSON
- `status` VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'PENDING'
    -- 'PENDING' | 'APPROVED' | 'REJECTED'
- `created_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
- `updated_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now()

We will later reuse this table to:
- Link events → promoters.
- Control who can access the promoter dashboard.

---

### 3.2 New table: `event_passport_billing`

Tracks **per-event fees** for using Soca Passport. This is scaffolding for monetization; we don’t need full payment flows yet.

Fields:

- `id` UUID PK
- `event_id` UUID NOT NULL          -- FK → events(id)
- `promoter_id` UUID NULL           -- FK → promoters(id)
- `billing_model` VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'PER_EVENT'
    -- for now only 'PER_EVENT'; future: 'SUBSCRIPTION', 'HYBRID'
- `fee_amount_cents` INT NULL       -- e.g., 1999 (i.e. $19.99), value can be null until pricing decided
- `currency` VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD'
- `status` VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'DRAFT'
    -- 'DRAFT' | 'PENDING_PAYMENT' | 'PAID' | 'WAIVED'
- `notes` TEXT NULL
- `created_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
- `updated_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now()

MVP behavior:
- When an event is created by a promoter and Soca Passport is enabled for that event (future step), we can create a `event_passport_billing` row with status `DRAFT`.
- No actual payments or Stripe integration needed yet; just the data model.

---

### 3.3 New table: `passport_memberships`

Scaffolding for **user upgrades / premium tiers**.

Fields:

- `id` UUID PK
- `user_id` UUID NOT NULL           -- FK → users(id)
- `tier` VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL       -- e.g. 'FREE', 'GOLD', 'ELITE'
- `status` VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ACTIVE'
    -- 'ACTIVE' | 'CANCELLED' | 'EXPIRED'
- `started_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
- `expires_at` TIMESTAMP NULL
- `metadata_json` JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
    -- store Stripe subscription IDs, notes, etc. later

Initial behavior:
- Every Soca Passport user implicitly is considered FREE tier; we can:
  - Either infer that from absence of a membership row.
  - Or create a membership row with `tier = 'FREE'` when passport profile is created.
- No payment integration yet; just ability to:
  - Read the tier.
  - Later restrict features based on it.

---

## 4. API ENDPOINTS FOR THIS PHASE

We only need a few simple endpoints in this task.

### 4.1 `GET /api/passport/landing-info`

Purpose:
- Provide display data for `/socaport-app` (text, stats like “X passports created”, etc.).
- This can be basic now; even static placeholder numbers are fine.

Response example:

```json
{
  "totalPassportUsers": 0,
  "totalStampsIssued": 0
}
