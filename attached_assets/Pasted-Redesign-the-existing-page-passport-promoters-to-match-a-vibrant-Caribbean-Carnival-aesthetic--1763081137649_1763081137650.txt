Redesign the existing page `/passport-promoters` to match a **vibrant Caribbean Carnival aesthetic** while keeping the current structure and functionality intact.

### Goals:
1. Keep all existing sections (Hero → Features → How It Works).
2. Transform the visual identity to match:
   - Carnival neon colors
   - Soca culture textures
   - Mas-inspired overlays
   - Luxury Caribbean nightlife (Savage Gentlemen look)
3. Do NOT change backend functionality; ONLY update UI + copy + styling.
4. Maintain dark mode base as the foundation.
